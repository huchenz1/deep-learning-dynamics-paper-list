This is a list of peer-reviewed representative papers on deep learning dynamics. Corrections and suggestions are welcomed.

# Introduction

The success of deep learning attributes to both network architecture and stochastic optimization. Understanding optimization dynamics of neural networks, namely deep learning dynamics, a key challenge in theoretical foundations of deep learning. A large body of related works have been published on top machine learning conferences and journals. However, a lterature review in this line of research is missing. It is highly valuable to continuously collect and share these great works. We hope to enjoy the grand adventure of exploring deep learning dynamics with more researchers.
